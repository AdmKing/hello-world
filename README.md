# hello-world
My name is Adams Raphael. i am an aspiring developer. i started my journey into tech about two years ago. i feel like i should've achieved more by now and that is what i'm trying to do. hence why i'm here, to learn. i can't help but feel a strong sense of imposter syndrome everytime i enter a space where i have to interract with other people in tech or when i have to tell people that i'm into web development. sometimes, it feels like i'm lying. i really want to learn more and be better. i know it takes time but i feel really impatient sometimes. i really want this to be my life.
